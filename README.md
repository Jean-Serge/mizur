# Mizur
Pronounced `/'meʒə/`

**Mizur** is a tool to simplify the management, conversion  
and mapping of units. 
The manipulation of measurement units should (at best) 
be typesafe.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mizur` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:mizur, "~> 2.0.0"}]
end
```
